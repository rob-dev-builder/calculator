1. get string value from display input

2. Listen out for number buttons being pressed
    If number is pressed then add it to display input

3. Listen out for operator numbers being pressed
    If operator button is pressed then call 'checkForOperator' function

      checkForOperator Function:
          Split the input string into characters
          Check through each character and if an operator is detected call the 'calculate' function

              calculate Function:
                Split the input string into characters
                Check through each character and call the 'prep' function for the relavant operator detected.

                    prep Function:
                       Split the input string by the relevant operator charactor


    After CheckForOperator function has run then add operator to input box


Note:
I could create a function that splits the input string by all the types of operators. Then it could return the operator array that has a length greater than 1.
